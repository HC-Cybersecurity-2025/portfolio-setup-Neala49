**Reflection:**  
  Cybersecurity is very important in our everyday lives as well as in things much bigger than ourselves. In our everyday lives, if we follow certain rules and actively try to protect ourselves online we can protect our information and potentially our lives at we now it.
For instance, if two people have the same routine every day. They both go to the same coffee shop in the morning, They both have social media they post on, and both work in high profile jobs but have different habits, that can greatly change their levels of cybersecurity.
The first one goes to the coffee shop but has their wifi set to auto-connect and the second one doesn't. This simple thing that most people do not pay attention to can affect you greatly by providing access to your device through the public internet. They both have 
social media that they post on. The first one has thier profile public and the second one has theirs set to private. This allows anyone to see anything the first person posts which can give easy to access information about where you go and what you do. And lastly, they
both work in high profile jobs. This makes them both targets but most criminals are lazy, So between someone who has a public account and connects to public wifi anywhere she goes and someone who has their profile private and stays on trusted internet sources. There is 
a clear choice of who a cyber-criminal would go for. So just a few habits can ward of a lot of attacks and keep your information just a little more safe, one step at a time.
  And like I said Cybersecurity is both in our everyday lives as well as in things much bigger than ourselves. Businesses across the world are trusted to keep people's information safe. But every single year there are more and more attacks on our information.
and technology is advancing to both steal information and protect it. Every single transaction of information has to be protected on a global scale for some companies and it is so much information and so much of an undertaking and most people do not think about it.
But it is all there and if someone does not ward against it. Someone will take advantage of the lack of work that a company has put in to steal information and that could be the end of that company. Their reputation depends on how well that take care of the information
that they are trusted with. For instance, would you rather spend your money on Amazon or whatever site you were redirected to to purchase an item you got an ad for. Of course it would be Amazon because of the reputation they have built that makes them more trustworthy in
most peoples eyes.
